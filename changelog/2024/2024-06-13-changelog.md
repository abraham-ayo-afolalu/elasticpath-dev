**MINOR** In Subscriptions, a new `card_id` attribute is available. You can use the `card_id` and `customer_id` attributes to program your front-end implementation to allow your preferred payment service provider to update a subscription with new card details, enabling you to easily manage your subscription changes.  For more information, see [Card Declines](/docs/api/subscriptions/imports).
