**MINOR** We have added the `unique_case_insensitivity` field for string validation in Commerce Extensions to control whether or not case differences, for example, ABC vs. abc, are treated as conflicting when `unique` is set to `yes`. For more information, see [String Validation](/docs/api/commerce-extensions/custom-fields#string-validation).

**MINOR** Commerce Manager: We have added the capability to copy exclusions between the **Actions** and **Conditions** sections in the Promotions Builder. For more information, see [Creating a Promotion in Promotions Builder](/docs/commerce-manager/promotions-builder/creating-a-promotion-in-promotions-builder).
