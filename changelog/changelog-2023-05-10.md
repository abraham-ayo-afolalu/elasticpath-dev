With introduction of Organizations to Elastic Path Commerce Cloud, as of May 23, 2023, only Org Admins will have the authority to create stores in their organization. An Organization is a container that holds multiple stores, allowing businesses to manage and configure commerce experiences at a higher level of abstraction. For more information, refer to the blog post or watch a quick video. To access your organization, contact our support team by submitting a support ticket.
