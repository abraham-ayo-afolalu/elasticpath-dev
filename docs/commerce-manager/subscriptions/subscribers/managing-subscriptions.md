You can manage the subscriptions for your subscribers. For example, you can pause, cancel and resume subscriptions or allow them to switch plans. For example, a customer might pause a meal delivery service during a vacation, or after resume a gym membership without having to start over with a new gym membership. Having a simple, straightforward process for pausing, cancelling and resuming subscriptions improves customer trust and satisfaction, improving customer retention and recovery.
