## Overview

Pagination is now supported in the Product Collection component and bug fixes in this release.

### Product Collection Component

The Product Collection component now supports pagination. 

For optimal performance, especially with large product collections, you should paginate your product collection component, rendering your products one page at a time instead of loading the entire product collection. Pagination makes it easier for your shoppers to browse through your product catalogs, allowing them to quickly find what they are looking for. In addition, you can choose from a selection of visually engaging indicator types and transitions. For example, if your indicator type is an arrow, then you might want to use a slide transition.
