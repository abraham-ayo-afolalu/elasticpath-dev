:::note
Every site has one timezone, so if you're working on a team distributed throughout multiple timezones, ensure they're aware of the time zone the site's scheduling is based on.
:::

## Adjusting Your Timezone

1. Navigate to the "General" tab under Settings on the left navigation bar.
2. Under "Account" a dropdown below the label "Timezone," click the dropdown to display our timezone options and select the correct timezone for your site.
3. Click the Save button, which will appear when the current timezone setting has been altered.

  Which roles may adjust this setting?.
*
    * Admin or Account Owner
---
*  
  I cannot find the time zone setting, it's not appearing for me.
* 
  There are two possibilities:
  
    * You do not have the correct role and need to contact your account admin
    * You need to hard refresh your browser: CTRL + SHIFT + R. Try hard-refreshing first, then contact your account's admin.
