With a **Full+** or **Enterprise** level subscription in Studio, AMP version of your articles are automatically created for your blog articles.

If you're on one of these plans, then you may notice the box is checked off and can't be unchecked. The reason for this is that at this time, *it's not currently possible to disable the creation of AMP versions of your articles.*

If you're not on either of these plans, then you'll need to [upgrade](/docs/studio/Settings/account-management/Upgrading-your-Unstack-Account) in order to enable this feature.

## What are the benefits of AMP?
