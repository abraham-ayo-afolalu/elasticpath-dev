Offerings represent a snapshot of their product and plans. If you make updates to a product or plans within an offering, the original product and plans are not updated. Only the product and plans within the offering are updated. Alternatively, you can create a new product and attach it to a new offering.

An offering includes a product and plans; a product is combined with one or more plans to form an offering. 

For example, your company provides online streaming of movies, web-series, and music. Your customers can purchase these services through either a weekly or monthly plan.

## Building Offerings: An Overview

Here's how you build an offering:

1. Attach your repeat product. An offering can have only one product. See [Repeat Products](/docs/subscriptions/products/managing-products-cm).
2. Attach your plans.
    - Plans are the rules that govern your subscription, for example, any discount.
    - You can combine and reuse plans for as many products as you want, making it quick and easy to create your subscription offerings.
    - An offering must have at least one plan. See [Plans](/docs/subscriptions/subscription-plans/managing-subscription-plans-cm).
3. [Create your offerings](/docs/subscriptions/offerings/managing-subscription-offerings). Offerings are the products and plans that a customer can choose. An offering can consist of many combinations of products or plans, depending on the products and services you offer.
    - When a customer chooses a plan, a subscription is created.
    - Elastic Path Subscriptions manages the billing and recurring payments associated with the subscription.
