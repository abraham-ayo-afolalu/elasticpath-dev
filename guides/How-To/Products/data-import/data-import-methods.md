Effective data importation into Elastic Path's Product Experience Manager (PXM) is crucial for establishing your stores and migrating data from other internal systems or third-party platforms. This article delves into the technical aspects of importing various types of data into your Elastic Path store, encompassing products, price books, and integrations with third-party platforms.

There are a number of ways to get data in to your Elastic Path store, depending on the type of data.

- product import, using either [Product Import APIs](/docs/api/pxm/products/product-import-bulk-update) or [Commerce Manager](/docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/product-import/product-importer).
- price book and product prices import, using either [Price Book Import API](/docs/api/pxm/pricebooks/import-a-price-book-and-prices) or [Commerce Manager](/docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/pricebooks/pxm-pricebooks#importing-price-books-and-prices).
- pre-defined integrations with third-party platforms, Pimberly, Salsify, Yotpo, and Shopify using Integrations Hub in Composer. See [Product Information](/docs/composer/integration-hub/product-information/salsify).
