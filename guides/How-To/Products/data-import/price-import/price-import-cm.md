You can create and update product price books and prices in bulk, at both organization and store level. This is useful, for example, if you have a promotion and want to update 50,000 product prices. Rather than having to go to each price book and manually edit 50,000 prices, you can bulk update all your product prices at the same time, including setting different prices for different currencies.

You can create/update:

- price books.
- prices.
    - sales pricing for products and product bundles with SKUs.
    - volume pricing (tiers).

Price book and price import uses a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file to import/update price books and prices. [Create a comma separated values file](/docs/api/pxm/pricebooks/import-a-price-book-and-prices#characteristics-of-price-book-import) that contains the price books and prices to import.

You can import price books and prices using [Commerce Manager](/docs/commerce-manager/product-experience-manager/pricebooks/pxm-pricebooks#importing-price-books-and-prices).
